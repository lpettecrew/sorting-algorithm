# Sorting Algorithm

### Introduction

This project will give the user the ability to sort a list of numbers or words either alphabetically or numerically in ascending or descending order.

## Algorithms

The user should be able to chose to sort their list with one of the following algorithms:
- [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort)
- [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
- [Quick sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)

## Usability

The user should be presented with a clean UI, and the ability to select an algorithm from a dropdown menu, as well as being given the option to generate a random list of numbers, or words.

When sorting, an animation should play, showing clearly how the algorithm is working. (Optional) The user could have the option to also change the speed at which the sorting animation plays at.
